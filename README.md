## Log

### Day 1

I've used a nested loop to iterate over the input, with the only optimization of not iterating over pairs of numbers that have been tried before (since addition is commutative):

```rust
for i in 0..entries.len() {
  for j in (i + 1)..entries.len() {
    // ...
  }
```

For **part 2** I added a third nested loop to get the third element to add. We avoid entering into this loop if we know the solution is impossible to reach using that combination (if the first two element already exceed the target).

```rust
for i in 0..entries.len() {
  for j in (i + 1)..entries.len() {
    if entries[i] + entries[j] > TARGET {
      continue;
    }

    for k in (j + 1)..entries.len() {
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

### Day 2

I learned a bunch of Rust with today's puzzle:

- How to create regexes with named capture groups.
- Use the `lazy_static!` macro to compute a value only once
- How to return a closure

I used a regex to parse the policy and extract its config:

```rust
lazy_static! {
  static ref PARSER: Regex =
    Regex::new(r"(?P<num1>\d+)\-(?P<num2>\d+)\s(?P<character>\w)").unwrap();
}
```

And then I have two functions (one per password policy) that return a closure that performs the password validation. For instance, this is the closure returned for the first policy:

```rust
Box::new(move |text| {
  let amount = text
    .chars()
    .filter(|&x| x == policy.character)
    .collect::<String>()
    .len() as u32;
  amount >= policy.num1 && amount <= policy.num2
})
```

### Day 3

I took this as an opportunity to learn how to implement a custom iterator in Rust.

```rust
impl SlopeIterator {
  fn new(slope: (usize, usize), map: &Map) -> Self {
    SlopeIterator {
      slope: slope,
      current: (0, 0),
      limit: (usize::MAX, map.height - 1),
    }
  }
}

impl Iterator for SlopeIterator {
  type Item = (usize, usize);

  fn next(&mut self) -> Option<(usize, usize)> {
    if self.current.0 > self.limit.0 || self.current.1 > self.limit.1 {
      return None;
    }

    let res = self.current;
    self.current.0 += self.slope.0;
    self.current.1 += self.slope.1;

    return Some(res);
  }
}
```

With that iterator, traversing the map to look for cells with trees it's quite simple:

```rust
iterator.fold(0, |total, (x, y)| {
  let inc = match map.get_cell(x, y) {
    Some(Cell::Tree) => 1,
    _ => 0,
  };

  total + inc
})
```

I had problems with **part 2**, because it asks to multiply partial results and supply that result as the answer for the puzzle, but I was using `u32` and there was an overflow I wasn't noticingâ€¦ I got the real result once I switched to `u64`.

### Day 4

Today's puzzles were simple, but tedious. I'm thankful for how easy is to add and run unit tests in Rust.

I decided to use "new" (for me in Rust!) data structures: `HashMap` to hold the passport information, and `HashSet` for the required fields. This way, it's easy to see which fields are missing:

```rust
let required_fields: HashSet<String> = ["ecl", "pid", "eyr", "hcl", "byr", "iyr", "cid", "hgt"]
    .iter()
    .map(|x| x.to_string())
    .collect();

let passport_fields: HashSet<String> = passport.keys().cloned().collect();
let missing: Vec<&String> = required_fields.difference(&passport_fields).collect();
```

For part 2, I ended up creating separate functions to validate each data type â€“so I could unit test them separately. Once that's in place, checking whether a field is valid with `match` is quite readable:

```rust
let is_valid: bool = match field.as_str() {
  "byr" => is_valid_number(value, 1920, 2002),
  "iyr" => is_valid_number(value, 2010, 2020),
  "eyr" => is_valid_number(value, 2020, 2030),
  "hgt" => is_valid_height(value),
  "hcl" => is_valid_hex_number(value),
  "ecl" => is_valid_eye_color(value),
  "pid" => is_valid_passport_id(value),
  "cid" => true,
  _ => false,
};
```

### Day 5

Today's been more fun that yesterday. I created a recursive function to do this partition of left/front vs right/back, and got to play with ranges in Rust:

```rust
pub fn locate(range: Range<usize>, locator: &[Dir]) -> usize {
  let length = range.len();

  if length > 2 {
    let new_range = match locator[0] {
      Dir::Lower => range.start..(range.start + length / 2),
      Dir::Higher => (range.start + length / 2)..range.end,
    };
    locate(new_range, &locator[1..])
  } else {
    match locator[0] {
      Dir::Lower => range.start,
      Dir::Higher => range.end - 1, // -1 because range.end is not inclusive
    }
  }
}
```

For the second part of the puzzle, the hardest bit was to understand the wording of the problem ðŸ˜…

### Day 6

Today's puzzle was perfect for practicing with `HashSet`s. Part 1 was quite easy, I just had to build a list of sets with the answers of each group, removing any repitition (which is done automatically in sets):

```rust
type Group = HashSet<char>;

// ...
#[aoc_generator(day6, part1)]
pub fn parse_input_part1(input: &str) -> Vec<Group> {
  input
    .split("\n\n")
    .map(|raw_group| {
      raw_group
        .lines()
        .collect::<Vec<&str>>()
        .concat()
        .chars()
        .collect()
    })
    .collect()
}
```

Part 2 was more challenging in terms of references, copying, etc. This solution is not performant memory-wise (since a new set is created for each intersection operation), but it works:

```rust
input
  .split("\n\n")
  .map(|raw_group| {
    let answers: Vec<Group> = raw_group
      .lines()
      .collect::<Vec<&str>>()
      .iter()
      .map(|person_answers| person_answers.chars().collect::<Group>())
      .collect();

    answers.iter().fold(answers[0].clone(), |result, partial| {
      result.intersection(&partial).copied().collect::<Group>()
    })
  })
  .collect()`
```

### Day 7

So this one was frustrating, because what I chose to do for part 1 was not the proper approach to handle part 2â€¦ Initially I had a ruleset in the form of a `HashMap`, whose keys were the _contained_ bag, and the values where the _container_ bags.

```rust
type Ruleset = HashMap<String, Vec<String>>;

fn find_containers(ruleset: &Ruleset, targets: &[String]) -> HashSet<String> {
  let mut result: HashSet<String> = HashSet::new();
  for target in targets.iter() {
    if let Some(containers) = ruleset.get(&target.to_string()) {
      result.extend(containers.iter().cloned());
      result.extend(find_containers(ruleset, containers));
    }
  }
  result
}
```

For part 2, not only we had to take into account how many other bags a bag could hold, but it required a top-bottom approach (i.e. start from one bag, and go through all of its contents). So I changed the ruleset for a new `HashMap`, this time with the _containers_ as keys, and their contents as `(amount, bag_color)` pairs.

Since today I had a day off at work, and I had the time, I ended up refactoring part 1 code so it could use this same data structure:

```rust
fn find_containers(ruleset: &Ruleset, target: &str) -> HashSet<String> {
  let mut result: HashSet<String> = HashSet::new();

  for (outer, inner) in ruleset.iter() {
    if inner.iter().find(|(_, color)| color == target).is_some() {
      result.insert(outer.to_string());
      result.extend(find_containers(ruleset, outer))
    }
  }

  result
}

fn find_amount_contained(ruleset: &Ruleset, target: &str) -> u32 {
  let mut result: u32 = 0;

  if let Some(contained) = ruleset.get(target) {
    for (amount, bag) in contained {
      result += amount + amount * find_amount_contained(ruleset, bag);
    }
  }

  result
}
```
